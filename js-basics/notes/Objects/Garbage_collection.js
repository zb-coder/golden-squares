// garbage collector

// In Javascript we have something called a garbage collector
// The job of the garbage collector is to find the variables or constants that are no longer used
// and then deallocate the memory that was allocated to them earlier.

// In Javascript memory allocation and deallocation happend automatically behind the scenes.
