// Strict Equality (Type + Value)
// This Operator ensures both numbers have the same type and have the same value.
// The example below, on both sides of the operator we have two numbers, so their type as well as their value is the same.
// console.log(1 === 1);


// Lose Equality (Value)
// This Operator compares the values only.
// This Operator looks at what we have on the left side and then automatically converts the value on the right side to what is on the left.
console.log(1 == 1);

//Best practice is to use the strict equality operator.
