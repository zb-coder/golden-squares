This repository This project will use a few components:

Ruby
The programming language.

Bundler
A tool for managing dependencies in a Ruby project. A dependency is a piece of software someone else has written to help others build programs. In Ruby these dependencies are known as 'Gems'.

RSpec
A test framework for use with Ruby. A test framework is a tool for writing and running tests.

Git
A version control system for use with any programming language. In the industry software projects are changed by many people in small steps, and version control systems help us keep track of those changes.


This repository is where I will practice the following things:

* Practice test-driving programs with multiple classes.
* Practice breaking programs up into classes.
* Practice debugging my programs.
* Practice building software.
* Practice explaining why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

I will do this by working through a few exercises provided by makers in this sequance:

Phase One: Testing Bites

Here I will practice:
* Testing methods
* Testing classes 
* Testing for errors

Phase Two: Skill Challenges

Here I will complete a series of challenges prepared by Makers. These challenges are desiigned to help me learn a strong test-driving, object-oriented design, and debugging practices.
