This repository is where I will practice the following things:

* Practice test-driving programs with multiple classes.
* Practice breaking programs up into classes.
* Practice debugging my programs.
* Practice building software.
* Practice explaining why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

I will do this by working through a few exercises provided by makers in this sequance:

Phase One: Testing Bites

Here I will practice:
